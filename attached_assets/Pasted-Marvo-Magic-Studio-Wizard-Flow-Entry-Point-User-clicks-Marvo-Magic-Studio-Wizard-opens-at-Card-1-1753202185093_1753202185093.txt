Card 3: Scaled Content Preview
Purpose: Give users a WYSIWYG preview at the correct aspect ratio and layout.

One preview pane per platform, sized and styled to match the real UI (1:1, 9:16, 16:9, etc.).
Inside each pane: image/video + caption + hashtags + audio icon.

On success: show full‑screen celebratory animation (confetti effect), toast “Your posts are live!”
Reset wizardState → return to Card 1.
Add More to Campaign
Push current batch into wizardState.campaignQueue.
Show toast “Nice work! This batch is queued under Campaigns.”
Keep wizardState intact → reset to Card 1 for additional builds.
Schedule for Later

On save: celebratory toast “Scheduled!” + reset wizard.
Save for Later
Prompt confirmation dialog “Save progress and exit?”
If Yes: snapshot wizardState under a UUID; render a new “Saved Wizards” card beneath wizard with links to resume.

Wizard Navigation & Resumption

Breadcrumb or Stepper at top showing 1‒4; user can click back to previous cards without losing state.
Saved Wizards Panel (collapsed under Card 4 when any saves exist):
Lists each save by date + type (e.g. “04: Blog + IG Carousel”)
“Resume” loads that snapshot into wizardState and jumps to the last‑visited card.
