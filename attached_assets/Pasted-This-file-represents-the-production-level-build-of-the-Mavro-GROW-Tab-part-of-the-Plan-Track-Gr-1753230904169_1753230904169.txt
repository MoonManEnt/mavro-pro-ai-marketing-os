This file represents the production-level build of the Mavro GROW Tab, part of the Plan → Track → Grow ecosystem. It must be implemented with full fidelity to the Sierra Canyon UI spec and should remain tightly consistent with ViVi’s modular intelligence infrastructure.
✅ DO NOT Modify the Following
UI layout (2-column modular grid with glassmorphism)
Typography hierarchy, backdrop blur, and rounded-xl styling
Color scheme and spacing — must match Mavro's native system-wide design tokens
Icons: must use lucide-react (no replacements or alternates)
All insight language generated by ViVi must remain intact as written
📂 File Name
components/GrowTab/KPIGrid.jsx
🛠️ Core Behaviors You MUST Preserve
Functionality	Description
fetchKPIData() polling	Pulls fresh KPI data from /api/kpi-sample every 10 seconds
KPI Ribbons	Applies performance-based tags like "🔥 Top Growth" and "⚠️ ROI Dip" based on thresholds
Hover Overlays	Shows dynamic KPI tooltips (top-right) on hover
ViVi Strategy Popover	Button-triggered panel including ViVi’s human-readable guidance
“Launch These Actions” Button	Triggers real-time POST /api/vivi/deploy-strategy request with loading + success state
Strategy Deployment History	Logs timestamped summary with current KPI performance
Copyable History Log	Enables users to copy deployment entries to clipboard
Future Strategy Hub Integration	All strategyLog[] entries must persist or export to be readable by the Track tab → Strategy Hub
🧠 System Connectivity Notes
Every user-triggered action from this file must feed into the following downstream systems:
✅ Track Tab → Strategy Hub (to show deployment logs, activity history)
✅ Grow Tab → FourSIGHT™ predictive modeling
✅ Post Generator Studio (to reflect changes after ViVi strategy launches)
✅ CRM + Reports Panel (if connected via action triggers)
🔮 ViVi-Specific AI Behaviors to Maintain
Real-time alert awareness (e.g., when ROI dips)
KPI-based summary building (dynamic string generation on launch)
Launch confirmation alerts and UI feedback
Intelligent recommendations must be shown in plain, strategic language
🔐 Security & UX Notes
All user inputs (clicks, strategy logs, exports) must be captured in memory or logged via persistent layer (localStorage, indexedDB, or remote DB in production)
Clipboard actions (navigator.clipboard.writeText()) must remain native
Alerts must never block UI transitions (use non-blocking toasts in future if upgraded)

🧱 Final Note
This tab serves as the live AI command center for the user. Treat every render cycle and insight as if it's powering a multi-platform SMB GTM operation. All data, alerts, suggestions, and strategy deployments from this view must remain auditable, consistent, and transparent across the rest of the Mavro platform.
