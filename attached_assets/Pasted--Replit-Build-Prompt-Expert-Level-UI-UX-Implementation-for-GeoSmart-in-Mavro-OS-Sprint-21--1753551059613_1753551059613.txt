🧠 Replit Build Prompt: Expert-Level UI/UX Implementation for GeoSmart in Mavro OS (Sprint 21)

👨‍💻 Role: You are acting as a senior UI/UX engineer building the **GeoSmart Intelligence Dashboard** inside the Mavro OS React app. The design must be fully modular, responsive, and follow the current component patterns used throughout Mavro OS (e.g., ViViMissionLogDashboard.jsx, CampaignDetailDrawer.jsx, and Scheduler.jsx).

---

# 🎯 OBJECTIVE:

Design and build a **data-rich, interactive GeoSmart page** that visualizes content and campaign performance by region (ZIP, city, state) and enables ViVi to deliver **real-time nudges**, trend insights, and boost recommendations.

The GeoSmart system is meant to function as an **AI-powered growth radar** for SMBs — helping them see *where* they’re growing and act on it.

# 📐 UI/UX DESIGN STRUCTURE

## Page: `GeoSmartDashboard.jsx`
- Full-width layout with responsive flex columns
- Should contain:
  - Left panel: **Region Summary + Filters**
  - Center panel: **GeoSmartHeatmap.jsx**
  - Right panel: **ViVi Nudge Stack + Drill Down**

## COMPONENTS & FUNCTIONALITY

### 🗺️ `GeoSmartHeatmap.jsx`
- Powered by Mapbox GL JS or Google Maps API
- Color-coded heat layer based on reach or engagement intensity:
  - Red = High engagement
  - Orange = Moderate
  - Blue = Low
- Each ZIP should be clickable
- On hover: show tooltip with:
  - ZIP code
  - City/State
  - Reach (total)
  - Engagement rate
  - Trending tag/audio
- On click: open `GeoSmartDrillModal.jsx`

### 📊 `GeoSmartPostStatsPanel.jsx`
- Scrollable table or card list of posts filtered by region
- Shows:
  - Post preview (platform icon + snippet)
  - Format (Reel, Story, Post)
  - Boost level
  - Scheduled date
  - Engagement rate
- Filter bar:
  - By campaign
  - By format
  - By boost level
  - By status (Scheduled, Live, Completed)

### 🧠 `GeoSmartViViNudge.jsx`
- Panel that shows ViVi-generated suggestions
- Each nudge card includes:
  - Trigger type: Trend Surge, Engagement Spike, Format Opportunity
  - Region + ZIP
  - Confidence score (e.g., “87% chance of improved engagement”)
  - Suggested action (e.g., “Boost next post in 78704” or “Clone top post for Austin”)
  - Accept, Dismiss, or Schedule action buttons

### 🔍 `GeoSmartDrillModal.jsx`
- Full-screen or floating modal
- Displays full breakdown for a region:
  - Campaigns active in region
  - Posts + status
  - Top performing content
  - Conversion rate (if CRM available)
  - TrendTap Pro overlays
- Ability to export PDF report from modal

### 📈 `GeoTrendTicker.jsx` *(Optional enhancement)*
- Marquee-style scroll of trending tags/audio by ZIP
- Data from `TrendTap Pro`

# 🔗 INTEGRATION & CONTEXTUAL BEHAVIOR

### Context Hooks
- Use `ViViContext.getActivePersona()` to filter map/trends
- Use `ViViPersonaContext.getTone()` to shape language of nudges

### Data Sources
- `scheduledPosts.json` – For scheduling density and post placement
- `campaigns.json` – To color-code active vs inactive regions
- `geoPostPerformance.json` – For reach, CTR, boost data
- `geoTrendFeed.json` – From TrendTap Pro for per-ZIP trending tag/audio
- `geoRegionMap.json` – Post → ZIP → city/state mapping

---

# 🧪 UI/UX BEHAVIOR

- **Initial load**:
  - Heatmap loads with default persona + platform filters applied
  - Region summary auto-pulls top 3 ZIPs by engagement delta

- **Hover interaction**:
  - Region glow + tooltip
  - Data panel updates to show stats for that ZIP

- **Click interaction**:
  - Opens `GeoSmartDrillModal.jsx`

- **Mobile responsive**:
  - Switch layout to stacked cards:
    - Heatmap collapses into image or reduced-width interactive map
    - Stats panel becomes accordion
    - Nudges are swipeable left/right

---

# 📦 DESIGN DETAILS

- Use **Tailwind CSS** with Mavro's theme:
  - `rounded-2xl`, `shadow-md`, `text-gray-800`, `bg-white`, `border-gray-200`
- Maintain spacing consistency: `p-4`, `gap-4`, `grid-cols-12`, etc.
- Match platform colors (IG = purple, FB = blue, TikTok = aqua)
- Use `lucide-react` icons for map markers, buttons, UI flourishes

---

# ✅ FINAL OUTCOME

The GeoSmart page should provide:
- Live regional content intelligence
- Seamless ViVi strategy integration
- Interactive heatmap experience
- Actionable nudges + smart post recommendations
- Exportable insights

Once built, this page becomes Mavro’s **GTM war map** — empowering SMBs to dominate their territory with ViVi leading the charge.
