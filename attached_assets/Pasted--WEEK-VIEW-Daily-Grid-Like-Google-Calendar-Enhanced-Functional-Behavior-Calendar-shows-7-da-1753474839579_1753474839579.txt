📆 WEEK VIEW: Daily Grid, Like Google Calendar (Enhanced)
✅ Functional Behavior:
Calendar shows 7-day grid, time-slotted
All scheduled content (posts, emails, reels, etc.) are visibly embedded within their respective time blocks
🔍 Interactivity:
Each scheduled item appears as a colored card (based on platform):
Instagram = Purple
TikTok = Aqua
Facebook = Blue
X = Black
Google Biz = Red
YouTube = Dark Gray
Hovering over a post:
Tooltip/modal preview appears
Platform + Time
Media thumbnail
Caption snippet
Hashtag summary
Boost level
Post status (Draft, Scheduled, Published)
🎯 Status Indicator (ViVi-Synced):
Dark-toned card = Post is scheduled but hasn’t gone out yet
Faded/lightened card = Post has already gone live
This allows users to know—at a glance—what’s ahead and what’s completed.
🗓 MONTH VIEW: Macro Visual Planner
✅ Functional Behavior:
Each day block shows a mini list view of scheduled items
Instead of full thumbnails, display:
Platform icon + colored pill
1–2 word label or emoji tag for format (e.g., “Reel”, “Blog”, “Post”)
Total count if over 3: “+2 more”
🧠 Hover-Over Interactivity:
Hovering over a day opens a preview popup with:
All post content for that day
Their respective platforms
Time of publish
Boost level or campaign tag
Post status (scheduled vs. already fired)
🎨 Color Coding:
Platform-color tagging per post (as above)
Dark shade = Scheduled but pending
Light/faded shade = Completed/published
For example:
Day	Scheduled
Aug 26	🔵 11:00 AM FB Post
⚫ 1:00 PM X Reel
🔴 3:00 PM Google Biz
If all 3 have already been published, they’ll show as light-toned icons.
If one is still pending, only that one retains the dark, active hue.
🔄 System-Wide Consistency & Benefits
🔧 Code-Level Matching:
Visual Feature	Data Source
Status (fired or not)	scheduledPosts.json.status + timestamp vs. current time
Platform color	platformProfiles.json.colorTheme
Hover content preview	Pulls from PostPreviewRenderer.jsx
Light/dark visual class	CSS class applied dynamically via post state check (isPublished)
ViVi commentary	ViViContext.scheduleInsights (e.g., “You’ve doubled up on Reels Wednesday — want to space that?”)
🧬 Final Scheduler UX Touches
Feature	Description
🔁 Syncs Across Tabs	Scheduler state reflects in GTM tab, Campaign Composer, and CRM
🧠 AI Nudges	ViVi prompts show at top of calendar when gaps or over-saturations are detected
📥 Drag In Drafts	Drag from “Unscheduled Drafts” tray into the calendar and auto-open post settings
📌 Pin Mode	User can “pin” a high-priority post so it doesn’t get bumped by AutoSchedule
✅ TL;DR: Scheduler Final View Logic
View	Functionality	Color Rules
Week View	Like Google Calendar — full-size post cards per time block	Dark = pending, Faded = published
Month View	Icon + tag-based platform highlights with popover preview	Platform color per post, same dark/fade logic
All Views	Hover = preview, click = edit post, drag = reschedule	ViVi suggests best times dynamically
