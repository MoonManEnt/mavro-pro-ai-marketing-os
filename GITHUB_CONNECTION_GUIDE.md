# GitHub Connection Guide for Mavro OS

## Current Status
Your project has Git configured but the GitHub repository URL needs to be updated.

**Current Setup:**
- Git user: MoonManEnt (rmsj14@gmail.com)
- Remote URL: `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/mavro-pro-ai-marketing-os.git` (needs fixing)
- Latest commits are ready to push

## Steps to Connect to GitHub

### Step 1: Create GitHub Repository (if needed)
1. Go to https://github.com/MoonManEnt
2. Click "New" to create a new repository
3. Name it: `mavro-pro-ai-marketing-os`
4. Make it public or private (your choice)
5. **Do NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (your project already has these)

### Step 2: Update Remote URL in Replit Shell
Open the Replit Shell and run these commands:

```bash
# Remove existing remote
git remote remove origin

# Add correct remote URL
git remote add origin https://github.com/MoonManEnt/mavro-pro-ai-marketing-os.git

# Verify the remote is correct
git remote -v
```

### Step 3: Push Your Code to GitHub
```bash
# Ensure you're on main branch
git branch -M main

# Push to GitHub (first time)
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 4: Authentication
When prompted for credentials:
- **Username**: MoonManEnt
- **Password**: Use a GitHub Personal Access Token

#### Creating Personal Access Token:
1. Go to GitHub Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Tokens (classic)
2. Click "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Select scopes: `repo` (full control of repositories)
4. Copy the token and use it as your password

### Alternative: Using Replit's Git Integration
1. In Replit, go to the "Version control" tab (Git icon in sidebar)
2. Click "Connect to GitHub"
3. Authorize Replit to access your GitHub account
4. Select or create the repository: `mavro-pro-ai-marketing-os`

## What's Ready to Push

## Troubleshooting
If you encounter issues:
1. Make sure the GitHub repository exists
2. Verify your Personal Access Token has correct permissions
3. Check that your internet connection is stable
4. Try using GitHub CLI: `gh repo create mavro-pro-ai-marketing-os --public --source=. --remote=origin --push`
