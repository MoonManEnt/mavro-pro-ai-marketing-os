# Mavro OS Deployment Guide

## Production Deployment Fixes Applied

### Issue Resolution
The deployment was failing due to missing 'multer' dependency in the production bundle. The following fixes have been implemented:

### ‚úÖ Fixes Applied

1. **Added multer to production dependencies**
   - Installed `multer` and `@types/multer` packages
   - Now properly included in the production bundle

2. **Removed unused multer import**
   - Cleaned up `server/routes/vivi.js` to remove unused multer import
   - This prevents bundling issues with unused dependencies

3. **Created production build script**
   - Added `build-production.sh` script with proper environment configuration
   - Ensures all dependencies are included in production builds

4. **Added deployment environment configuration**
   - Created `deployment.env` with proper production settings
   - Set `NPM_CONFIG_PRODUCTION=false` to include dev dependencies in build

5. **Created esbuild configuration**
   - Added `esbuild.config.js` for optimized production bundling
   - Properly handles all dependencies except native modules

### üöÄ Deployment Instructions

#### Option 1: Use Replit Deploy Button
1. Click the Deploy button in your Replit interface
2. The deployment will now complete successfully with all dependencies

#### Option 2: Manual Production Build
```bash
# Run the production build script
./build-production.sh

# Or use the esbuild configuration directly
node esbuild.config.js
```

#### Option 3: Environment Variables (if needed)
If the deployment still has issues, add these environment variables in your deployment settings:
```
NODE_ENV=production
NPM_CONFIG_PRODUCTION=false
NODE_OPTIONS=--experimental-modules --enable-source-maps
```

### üì¶ What Was Fixed

- **Multer Dependency**: Now properly included in production dependencies
- **Bundle Configuration**: esbuild now bundles all required dependencies
- **Build Process**: Optimized for production deployment
- **Environment Setup**: Proper production environment configuration

### üîç Verification

The application should now deploy successfully without the `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` error for multer or any other dependencies.

All file upload functionality (though not actively used) is now properly supported in production.

### üìã Next Steps

1. Deploy using Replit's deploy button
2. Verify the deployment starts successfully
3. Test the application functionality
4. Monitor for any additional dependency issues

If you encounter any other deployment issues, the build configuration can be further optimized based on the specific error messages.
