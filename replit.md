## Official Design System

**Executive Command Minimalism** - The established design philosophy for all UI/UX development:

### Core Design Principles
- **Ultra-clean white foundations** with sophisticated gradient overlays
- **Enterprise-grade visual hierarchy** with premium typography (font-black, tracking-tight)
- **Surgical use of color** - each gradient serves functional purpose (blue for insights, green for progress, orange for actions)
- **Micro-interaction sophistication** - hover scaling, shadow transitions, duration-500 animations

### Required Design Elements
- **Rounded-3xl architecture** for premium feel
- **Shadow-2xl to shadow-3xl** depth systems
- **Multi-layer gradients** (via-color combinations) creating sophisticated depth
- **Strategic status indicators** (pulsating dots, live badges) positioned for executive scanning
- **Premium spacing systems** (p-8, space-y-8) for optimal breathing room

### Visual Standards
- **Typography**: Font-black weights, tracking-tight spacing, text-xl+ for headers
- **Colors**: Blue-to-indigo, green-to-emerald, orange-to-amber gradient combinations
- **Animations**: Duration-400 to duration-500, hover:scale-[1.02], enhanced shadow transitions
- **Layout**: Rounded-3xl cards, backdrop-blur effects, sophisticated border systems

This design system represents the pinnacle of "serious business software that feels approachable" - sophisticated enough for enterprise boardrooms while remaining intuitive for rapid decision-making.
