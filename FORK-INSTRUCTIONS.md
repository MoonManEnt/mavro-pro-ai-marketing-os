# How to Fork This Mavro Pro Project

## Method 1: Replit Fork (Easiest)

In the Replit interface, look for the fork button:
- **Location**: Top-right corner of the Replit workspace
- **Icon**: Branching symbol (looks like a "Y" or tree fork)
- **Action**: Click it to create your own copy

## Method 2: Use Export Package

If you can't find the fork button or prefer this method:

1. **Download the package**: `mavro-pro-ui-complete.tar.gz`
2. **Create new Replit**: Start a new workspace
3. **Upload and extract**: Upload the tar.gz file and extract it
4. **Install dependencies**: Run `npm install`
5. **Start the app**: Run `npm run dev`

## Method 3: Manual Copy

1. **Copy all files** from this workspace
2. **Create new Replit** workspace
3. **Paste files** into the new workspace
4. **Install dependencies**: `npm install`
5. **Start development**: `npm run dev`

## What You'll Have After Forking

Your forked version will include:
- All 6 business personas (Kemar Hinds, Karen Thompson, Sarah Martinez, Marco Romano, Alex Chen, David Wilson)
- ViVi AI assistant with voice capabilities
- FourSIGHT analytics dashboard
- GRIO Academy with marketing education
- Complete UI/UX with animations and responsive design
- All source code and documentation

## After Forking

Once you have your own copy:
- **Customize**: Change colors, add personas, modify content
- **Deploy**: Use Replit deployment or export to other platforms
- **Share**: Your fork will have its own URL
- **Modify**: Make any changes without affecting the original

The fork will be completely independent and ready for your own development.
