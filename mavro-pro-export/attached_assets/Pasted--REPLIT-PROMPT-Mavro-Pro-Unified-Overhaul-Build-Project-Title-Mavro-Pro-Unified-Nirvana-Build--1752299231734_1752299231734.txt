Glassmorphic cards + Sierra Canyon Sunset gradient theme
Drag-and-drop still powered by @dnd-kit, but clean layout adapted from Mavro Plus spacing/model
Tabs: Plan Mode, Track Mode, Grow Mode
🔧 SYSTEM MERGE STRATEGY

🗃️ FILES TO MERGE / MIGRATE
From Mavro Plus (ported over to client/src/demo/ or data/)
profiles.json – personas: Sarah (MedSpa), Marco (Restaurant), etc.
campaigns.json – mock campaigns per persona
leads.json – CRM sample leads
analytics.json – content engagement data
trendData.json – auto-scroll trend prompts
tourSteps.json – step-by-step UI intro
🧠 AI ENGINE UNIFICATION (server/vivi-mcp.ts)
Update ViVi's MCP engine to include:
personaContext: string as a required field
Ability to simulate 3 behavior modes:
Demo: Use mock JSON, no network call
Hybrid: Predict + auto-fill blanks with fake ROI
Live: Use actual synced CRM/campaign data
if (context.mode === "demo") {
  return mockPredictionEngine(userPersona, toolRequest);
}
🎨 UI/UX GUIDELINES
Keep glassmorphism + floating card style from Mavro Plus
Stick to shadcn/ui for all components
Maintain responsive, drag-and-drop flexibility
Adopt Zendaya-style tone for ViVi
Ensure ALL modules are demo-safe or toggled with switch
🔐 ACCESS MODES
Mode	Description
DEMO	Uses mock persona data and JSON files
LIVE	Uses authenticated CRM, OpenAI, user campaigns
HYBRID	Blends user data with predictive auto-fill logic
Controlled via AppContext.mode and localStorage
✅ OUTPUT & DEPLOYMENT REQUIREMENTS
100% portable ZIP with mock/demo data preloaded
No required external API tokens for DEMO mode
/demo-login: logs user in as mock persona
/dashboard = new Plan/Track/Grow layout
/crm, /analytics, /ai-studio, /roi-tools = extended
