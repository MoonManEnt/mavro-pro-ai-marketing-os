### Frontend Analysis:
- [ ] App.tsx router configuration efficiency
- [ ] Context provider optimization (7 providers may be excessive)
- [ ] useAuth.ts authentication logic security
- [ ] useTheme.ts dark mode implementation
- [ ] Component size and complexity (ExactMavroPlusDashboard.tsx is 3000+ lines)
- [ ] Bundle splitting opportunities
- [ ] Performance optimization opportunities

### Backend Analysis:
- [ ] server/routes.ts API structure and security
- [ ] Authentication middleware implementation
- [ ] Database schema design and relationships
- [ ] Error handling consistency
- [ ] Input validation completeness

### Configuration Analysis:
- [ ] package.json dependency optimization (50+ packages)
- [ ] Vite configuration efficiency
- [ ] Tailwind configuration optimization
- [ ] TypeScript configuration strictness

## üö® PRIORITY ISSUES TO ADDRESS

### CRITICAL (Fix Immediately):
1. 22 TypeScript errors in routes.ts and useAuth.ts
2. Security vulnerabilities in JWT handling
3. Performance issues from excessive context providers
4. Bundle size optimization needed

### HIGH PRIORITY:
1. Component decomposition (3000+ line dashboard)
2. State management consolidation
3. Error handling standardization
4. Testing implementation

### MEDIUM PRIORITY:
1. Code splitting implementation
2. API design consistency
3. Documentation improvements
4. Accessibility enhancements

## üèóÔ∏è ARCHITECTURAL VISION

The user has provided a comprehensive project structure document showing the ideal monorepo organization:

### Recommended Structure:
- **Modular Backend**: Separate controllers, services, middlewares, and utilities
- **Clean API Layer**: Proper separation between routes, controllers, and business logic
- **Service-Oriented**: Dedicated services for database, ViVi integration, and external APIs
- **Type Safety**: Shared schemas and types between client and server
- **Docker Integration**: Containerized PostgreSQL with proper environment management

### Key Improvements Needed:
1. **Restructure Backend**: Move from monolithic routes.ts to modular structure
2. **Implement Service Layer**: Create dedicated services for database operations
3. **Enhance Authentication**: Implement session-based auth with proper middleware
4. **Add Docker Support**: Containerize the application with PostgreSQL
5. **Improve Type Safety**: Create shared types and schemas

## üí° EXPECTED DELIVERABLES

Please provide:

1. **Executive Summary**: Top 5 most critical issues with impact assessment
2. **Architecture Transformation Plan**: Steps to implement the recommended structure
3. **Performance Audit**: Specific optimizations with expected improvements
4. **Security Review**: Vulnerabilities with remediation steps
5. **Implementation Roadmap**: Prioritized action items with effort estimates
6. **Migration Strategy**: How to transition from current to recommended structure

## üìä CODEBASE CONTEXT

- **Framework**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express + PostgreSQL + Drizzle ORM
- **Size**: ~15,000 lines of code
- **Components**: 50+ React components
- **API Routes**: 20+ endpoints
- **Dependencies**: 50+ npm packages
- **Current State**: Production-ready beta with dark mode toggle

## üéØ SUCCESS METRICS
